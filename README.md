# Prework - *App Project*

Submitted by: **Noelle Hom**

**App Project** is an app that displays three labels and a button that can change the background a different color.

Time spent: **1** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] Users are see a screen with three labels and a button
- [x] Tapping the button changes the screen color to a random color
 

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

Instagram: You can private your profile, different UI elements which are animated
Youtube: You can see your recommended videos and when you hit the bell icon it is animated
Snapchat: The bitmoji pops up when viewing messages and easy UI 

An app idea that I would like to build is a tip calculator because it will easily calculate tip amounts.

## Notes

Some challenges I had was figuring out where different buttons were on Xcode.
